  <h1>🏔️ Graphic Project for 42 Madrid</h1>

  <p>
    This project generates a <strong>3D landscape as a wireframe model</strong> in <strong>isometric view</strong>.
    I went above and beyond by creating an <strong>engine capable of rendering any 3D plane from any viewpoint</strong>,
    thanks to a custom algorithm designed for <strong>peak efficiency</strong>.
